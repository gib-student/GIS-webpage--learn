# Overview

For this project, I made a webpage which draws from the a geographic information system (GIS)
API to display a topographical map of Yellowstone National Park, 
with points indicating points of interest in the area. I took the locations and information 
of the points of interest from the official Yellowstone National Park website.

I created this to learn about GIS, how to use the API of a real company which offers it, 
and to learn the power and usefulness of these tools.

My software is easy to use; simply use the mouse to navigate around the map.
